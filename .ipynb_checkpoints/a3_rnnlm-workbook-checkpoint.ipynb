    "### Aside: Shapes Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's review our understanding of the shapes involved in this assignment and how they manifest themselves in the TF API.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the [instructions](rnnlm-instructions.ipynb) notebook, $w$ is a matrix of wordids with shape batch_size x max_time.  Passing this through the embedding layer, we retrieve the word embedding for each, resulting in $x$ having shape batch_size x max_time x embedding_dim.  I find it useful to draw this out on a piece of paper.  When you do, you should end up with a rectangular prism with batch_size height, max_time width and embedding_dim depth.  Many tensors in this assignment share this shape (e.g. $o$, the output from the LSTM, which represents the hidden layer going into the softmax to make a prediction at every time step in every batch).\n",

    "![Three Dimensional Shape](common_shape.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since batch size and sentence length are only resolved when we run the graph, we construct the placeholder using \"None\" in the dimensions we don't know.  The .shape property renders these as ?s.  This should be familiar to you from batch size handling in earlier assignments, only now there are two dimensions of variable length.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the next cell for a concrete example (though in practice, we'd use a TensorFlow variable that we can train for the embeddings rather than a static array).  Notice how the shape of x_val matches the shape described earlier in this cell."

    "\n",
    "We'll give you the outline of the training procedure, but you'll need to fill in a call to your `run_epoch` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of training, we use a `tf.train.Saver` to save a copy of the model to `/tmp/w266/a3_model/rnnlm_trained`. You'll want to load this from disk to work on later parts of the assignment; see **part (d)** for an example of how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "With a sampled softmax loss, the default hyperparameters should train 5 epochs in around 15 minutes on a single-core GCE instance, and reach a training set perplexity between 120-140.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's possible to do significantly better. Try experimenting with multiple RNN layers (`num_layers` > 1) or a larger hidden state - though you may also need to adjust the learning rate and number of epochs for a larger model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also experiment with a larger vocabulary. This will look worse for perplexity, but will be a better model overall as it won't treat so many words as `<unk>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed things up, you may want to re-start your GCE instance with more CPUs. Using a 16-core machine will train *very* quickly if using a sampled softmax lost, almost as fast as a GPU. (Because of the sequential nature of the model, GPUs aren't actually much faster than CPUs for training and running RNNs.) The training code will print the words-per-second processed; with the default settings on a single core, you can expect around 8000 WPS, or up to more than 25000 WPS on a fast multi-core machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to modify the code below to only run score_dataset at the very end, after all epochs are completed. This will speed things up significantly, since `score_dataset` uses the full softmax loss - and so often can take longer than a whole training epoch!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submitting your model\n",
    "You should submit your trained model along with the assignment. Do:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp /tmp/w266/a3_model/rnnlm_trained* .\n",
    "git add rnnlm_trained*\n",
    "git commit -m \"Adding trained model.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unless you train a very large model, these files should be < 50 MB and no problem for git to handle. If you do also train a large model, please only submit the smaller one."
